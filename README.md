# React State & Logic Calculator
A focused React application designed to demonstrate proficiency in state management, controlled components, and mathematical logic within a functional component architecture.
## 🚀 Features
Controlled Inputs: Real-time synchronization between the UI and React state using onChange handlers.
Mathematical Logic: Dynamic calculation of sums with proper string-to-number parsing.
State Reset: A dedicated "Clear" function to flush all input and result states back to their initial values.
Validation: Basic handling for number-only inputs using HTML5 input types.
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Library: React.dev (Functional Components)
State Management: useState Hook
Version Control: GitHub
📋 Implementation Details
The project follows a 5-step development process:
Input Handling: Setup of Calculator.jsx with two numerical input fields.
Controlled Components: Leveraging the value attribute and useState to ensure the "Source of Truth" remains within React.
Operation Logic: Implementation of a calculateSum function that uses parseFloat or Number() to ensure mathematical accuracy.
Reset Feature: A handler that resets num1, num2, and result states simultaneously.
Deployment: Version controlled via Git and hosted on GitHub.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
